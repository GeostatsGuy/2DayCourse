This repository includes the support material for this course.

#### Bio

Michael Pyrcz is an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He teaches and consults on the practice of geostatistical reservoir modeling and conducts research on new geostatistical methods to improve reservoir modeling and uncertainty for conventional and unconventional reservoirs. He has published over 40 peer reviewed technical articles, a textbook with Oxford University Press, and is an associated editor with Computers & Geosciences.

#### Course Objectives

Class will be accessible to geoscientists and data scientists with no previous experience with geostatistics. We will build up from data integration to spatial estimation and simulation along with uncertainty modeling to support decision making. After completion the students will understand: (1) the benefits and uses of geostatistics, (2) the common spatial and uncertainty modeling workflows, (3) how to better integrate their domain knowledge into the geostatistical model.

#### Course Outline

For the following 2-day class outline it is assumed that: (1) the class will be taught in English without translation, and (2) 1/3 of time will be guided hands-on practice

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
(a) Sampling theory, stationarity, data debiasing
(b) Random variables and functions
(c) Univariate statistics, multivariate statistics
(d) Geostatistics and big data analytics

2. Spatial Data Analysis
(a) Trend modeling
(b) Variogram calculation, interpretation and modeling
(c) Scaling relations
(d) Training images

3. Estimation
(a) Interpolation
(b) Kriging estimation
(c) Predrill prediction

4. Stochastic Simulation
(a) Simulation paradigm
(b) Gaussian simulation
(c) Minimum acceptance and uncertainty checks

5. Uncertainty Management
(a) (Spatial) bootstrap
(b) Model post-processing
(c) Uncertainty workflows

I am open to revisions to the outline to accommodate student learning needs.
